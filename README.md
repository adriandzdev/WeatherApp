# WeatherApp

This is a weather app written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of a single HTML file, which includes the layout and styling using CSS and a script file to handle the app's functionality. The app allows users to input the name of a city and retrieve the current weather conditions for that location.
The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and display it on the screen. The API is accessed using Axios, a popular HTTP client for JavaScript. The app retrieves the city's name, temperature, humidity, and weather condition, and displays them in designated areas on the screen.
The app also includes a warning message that is displayed if an invalid city name is entered. Additionally, the app displays an image that corresponds to the current weather condition. The app uses a switch statement to determine which image to display based on the weather condition's ID.
Overall, this weather app is a example of how to fetch and display data from an external API using JavaScript.
